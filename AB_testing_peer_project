-- 1. Compare the final_assignments_qa table to the assignment events we captured for user_level_testing. 
--   Write an answer to the following question: Does this table have everything you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?
-- 
-- 2. Write a query and table creation statement to make final_assignments_qa look like the final_assignments table. 
--   If you discovered something missing in part 1, you may fill in the value with a place holder of the appropriate data type. 

-- 3. Use the final_assignments table to calculate the order binary for the 30 day window after the test assignment for item_test_2 
--   (You may include the day the test started)

-- 4. Use the final_assignments table to calculate the view binary, and average views for the 30 day window after the test assignment for item_test_2. 
--   (You may include the day the test started)

-- 5. Use the https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics 
--   ( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence. 

-- 6. Use Mode’s Report builder feature to write up the test. Your write-up should include a title,
--   a graph for each of the two binary metrics you’ve calculated. 
--   The lift and p-value (from the AB test calculator) for each of the two metrics,
--   and a complete sentence to interpret the significance of each of the results.
